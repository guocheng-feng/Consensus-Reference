## Q1: What is Agenda Building Theory?

Cohen’s [[published in 1963](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691651156/press-and-foreign-policy)] classic dictum, “the media may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about,” (p. 13) is helpful in understanding what contemporary agenda-setting researchers have termed first- and second-level agenda- setting effects (McCombs et al., 1997, 2000).
